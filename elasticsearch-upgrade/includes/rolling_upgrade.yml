# Give the local node time to initialise the local shards
# NOTE: it's not reliable to wait for cluster state to turn yellow here.  Testing has shown that during a rolling upgrade
#       the cluster state can remain red at this point until shard allocation is enabled so best to re-enable it after
#       a short wait and then wait for it to turn green.
