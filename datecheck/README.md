Date Checker
=====================

Used to show an example play.

Notes
-----

This play does nothing, but shows the basic structure of how an Ansible oneshot
could be written.

Variables
---------

See main.yml for an example variable to be inherited.

This same variable (date of Star Wars release) is specified in the defaults 
directory, under main.yml.
